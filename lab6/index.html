					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Experimented with JavaScript arrays and objects.</p>
					
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't run into any challenges, we enjoyed using arrays.</p>
					
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>JavaScript is so much fun to code in since it is such a forgiving language.<br>
						With the use of arrays we were able to better structure our code and it<br>
						feels like it's not only more organized, but if just feels better to use<br>
						arrays in general.
					</p>
					
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The transportation we use: Mercedes C320, Black Low Top Air Force One's<br>
						with Marbled Soles, UCSC Loop Bus</p>
