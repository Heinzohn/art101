					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Experimented with JavaScript</p>
					
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't run into any siginificant problems</p>
					
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was quite the fun experiment! After we got a hang of how to work with innerHTML <br>
					(which was short thanks to the working on the first Task X question from lab 8), we looked up if it was possible<br>
					to change images. This lead us to discovering a cool button fuction that allows you to change the image through <br>
					innerHTML! Who doesn't love interactivity!?</p>
					
					<h2>Results</h2>	
					<p>Oh darn! I forgot to update the image from the last lab, would you mind doing it for me?</p>
					<button onclick="imgChange()">Update the Image!</button>

					<p>Man I am forgetful today! Do me a solid and change the title too?</p>
					<button onclick="titleChange()">Update the Title!</button>
