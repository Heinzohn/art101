      <p>My partner and I are named Elijah Hyson and Wes Babb. We are the Double Dragons of Art101. 
        Elijah (AKA Big Boss Kobra) is a man of skill and precision, a true marksman. I know this 
        because he loves actions games, and is one hell of a CSGO player. In his spare time he also 
        enjoys listening to jazz and electro music, which makes him one classy dude. I myself am a 
        person whom enjoys role playing and FPS games. I'm also working on become a brick house by 
        hitting up the gym everyday, and enjoy upgrading my computer regularly.</p>
