					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Experimenting with JSON and APIs</p>
					
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't run into any siginificant problems</p>
					
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab helped us practice working with AJAX and JSON. <br>
					We already had experience working with APIs from our group projects <br>
				    so implementation proved to be no hassle. While there was a little bit <br>
					of confusion on how to have a variable have JSON data, a quick search <br>
					on Stack Overflow provided clarity.</p>
					
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Better enjoy the comic while it lasts...it's set to the latest comic that's uploaded!</p>
