					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Experimenting with jQuery and AJAX</p>
					
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't run into any siginificant problems</p>
					
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>AJAX feels like a step up from jQuery in terms of the installation and potential usage.<br>
					The only problem we can see for it is if the url link we use becomes faulty but the same <br>
					can be said for most libraries that are installed via URL. We'll make sure that any future APIs <br>
					we use are popular and supported!</p>
