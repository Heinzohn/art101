					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<div id ="chal"><p>Experimented with JavaScript Loops</p></div>
					
					<h2>Problems</h2>
			        <p>We didn't run into any siginificant problems</p>
					
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The syntax of loops in JavaScript is quite similar to loops in Python.<br>
					This familiarity helped speed along the coding process. Although there's not many<br>
				    situations where looping could be useful outside of art purposes we could think of, <br>
                    we look forward to potentially using it for our group projects.</p>
