					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Debug previous labs</p>
					
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't run into any siginificant problems</p>
					
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Since we've had working code for the previous labs, <br>
						there was no need to debug. We used the debugger for VSCode <br>
						and experimented with the breakpoints. While we can understand that the <br>
						is helpful newcomers, we're already adept to having good coding grammer <br>
						It's always nice to have program double check your work though and to have <br>
						a quick way to test run your website!</p>
					
					<h2>Results</h2>

					<p>NONE HERE FOLKS!</p>
