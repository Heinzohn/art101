					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<div id ="chal"><p>Experimented with JavaScript conditionals</p></div>
					
					<h2>Problems</h2>
			        <p>We didn't run into any siginificant problems</p>
					
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was fairly easy to get into. Having experience with if statements in languages like <br>
					Python allowed to get creative for the first Task X question. While we are not exactly sure on <br>
					we can refactor this code, we look forward to finding potential uses for conditional statements <br>
				    in our seperate group projects</p>
					
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>It is time for your house assignment via the Advanced Hogwarts Assignment (A.H.A) Program!<br>
